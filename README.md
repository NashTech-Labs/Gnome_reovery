# GNOME RECOVERY

## How to use this template?
- So if you can only see a terminal on your linux machine while you opens it, there might be a problem with your GNOME. So we will be going to fix that in this template.

- If someone is interested in playing with their gnome and by mistake you came accross a situation where you uninstalled your gnome by mistake, then no need to worry or to reinstall the ubuntu system. You might run a command like " sudo apt purge python3 " then your gnome gets uninstalled as it is written in python3 so it will get deleted. You can recover that. you don't have to reinstall that.

- Firstly, you have to run the `installer_1.sh`. It might give you an error like `unknown command gnome-shell`.

- Then you have to run the second script i.e. `Installer_2.sh`. 

- Or you can run the commands seperately writen in the scripts.
